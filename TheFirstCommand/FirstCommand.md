# The Fist Command #
Hey!
I'm Milchreisfan and i want to teach you some coding :D

Here you learn about the first command in PocketMine-MP
But as first here are the basics

# The Begin #

As first you need an programm where you can code...
I use Visual Studio Code.
If you installed it go to your desktop and create a new folder e.g "plugins"
Now open the editor and open the folder in the editor
Create a new folder with the name of your plugin
In the folder with the plugin name create a file called "plugin.yml"
Then create a folder called "src"
In "src" you create another folder with "your name" and in the folder "your name" an folder with the name from the plugin
Now create a file called "Main.php"
Now you have the ground structure

So it have to look like:

src/your-name/plugin-name/Main.php
plugin.yml

# How i can code? # 
look in the other files :D

# How to make a .phar? #

I do it with a website
As first you open your folder with the plugin and make a zip
It have to looks like this:

only make the zip in the folder where is "plugin.yml" and "src"
now create the zip and name it like the plugin
now copy the plugin.yml and "src"-folder in the zip
now go to the webiste "https://pmt.nathfreder.dev/"
then go on Create .phar and open the zip folder there :D

# How do i make my plugin public on poggit? #

Go on https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/ (Make sure you are logged in with your github account)
Now push "add repo" and search for the repo and enable it
Here you go :D
